title: "Font pairing made simple" 
subtitle: "Generate ont combinations with deep learning"
paragraph: >-
    Click (Generate) to create a new font pairing, (Lock) to lock fonts that
    you want to keep, and (Edit) to choose a font manually. The text is
    editable, try replacing it with your company name or other copy. The goal
    of font pairing is to select fonts that share an overarching theme yet
    have a pleasing contrast. Which fonts work together is largely a matter of
    intuition, but we approach this problem with a neural net. See Github for
    more technical details.
